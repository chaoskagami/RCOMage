RCOMage Changelog:

Dev Version
 - Experimental GIM -> BMP support. It works horribly, be very surprised if you get something usable at the moment.

ZingaBurga Dev version (Last commit - 4y ago)
 - Update INIs - this will change the XML format and may cause incompatibilities with XMLs dumped from earlier versions
 - Enable RLZ compression (no decompression support at the moment)
 - Some bug fixes and changes with VSMX handling

v1.1.1  (2nd June, 2010)
 - Add --ini-dir option to allow specifying INI directory for the CLI
 - Add version tag 0x97 as a valid PS3 tag (fixes some issues with dumping RCOs from older PS3 firmwares) [thanks to Mr Shizzy for the samples]
 - Export animtable tag constants to .ini file; also fix up PS3's special MoveTo animation
 - Minor modification to WAV parser - will now skip bytes if header specifies it
 - Remove UTF-8 BOMs from dumped XML before the text values - seems to cause issues on some machines (and I don't think it's exactly valid anyway)
 - Strip nulls from text (RCO Editor may add them)
 - Replace the various "unknownInt1" name with "accelMode" - thanks to Vegetano1 for the find

v1.1.0  (3rd Apr, 2010)
 - Minor message output changes
 - Fixed bug where rcomage may have tried to convert non-GIM images through gimconv when dumping
 - Fixed minor issue if Image/Sound/Text tree contained no subentries
 - Removed option to select compression for PNG/JPG/TIF/GIF resources in GUI as it's mostly useless and may break the RCO if changed
 - Add UMDFlag attribute to RcoFile tag
 - Reduce the use of CDATA sections in the dumped text XML file
 - Add basic VSMX decoder/encoder; add corresponding option when dumping/compiling in CLI and GUI, as well as vsmxdec and vsmxenc functions in the CLI
 - Add experimental VSMX -> Javascript decompiler.  This will most likely crash, but if you're lucky, it might go through and give half-readable output.  Only use this if you're really interested; can only be accessed via the CLI using the --decompile option of vsmxdec
 - Export some internal constants to .ini files
 - Add support for UTF8 and UTF32 text in RCOs (found in PS3 RCOs); also fixed some potential character encoding issues
 - Add support for Fontstyle entries (used in the sysconf PS3 RCO)
 - Greatly improve handling PS3 RCO object structures (thanks goes to geohot for RCO samples)
 - Add support for writing PS3 RCOs; also modify GimConv to add PS3 configuration option

v1.0.2  (7th Dec, 2009)
 - statically link all libraries; also now built with MinGW so MSVC runtime no longer required
 - include required DLLs with GimConv
 - fixed bug in GUI where it didn't chdir across drives
 - partially removed annoying auto-fill for dumping RCOs for GUI
 - fixed crash where bad label reference was supplied
 - add like two additional warnings
 - add ability to select zlib compression options from CLI
 - partial support for reading big-endian (PS3?) RCOs; it's "partial" as there are still issues - mainly object handling is mostly stuffed up
 - fix regression in earlier update which broke VSMX dumping
 - minor changes to XML format
 - apply hack which hopefully fixes up GimConv converting from some GIMs
 - and if the above still causes GimConv to freeze, added a timeout to try to not cause Rcomage to lock up as well
 - added "vagenc" and "vagdec" functions if you happen to want to convert a .vag file
 - added "extract" function (not 100% complete)

v1.0.1  (28th Oct, 2009)
 - fix crash with WAV -> VAG conversion
 - fix sound clipping issues with WAV -> VAG conversion (fix appears to work, but I really haven't looked at it much)
 - added ability for compile function to read from stdin
 - use \ for directory separators on Windows
 - slight speedup with gimconv (no longer invokes the cmd shell)
 - '--xml-only' switch for dumping removed, use '--resdir -' instead
 - fix bugs relating to handling XML files with resource dumping disabled
 - minor changes to messages
 - GUI will attempt to use relative paths instead of always relying on absolute paths
 - fix folder creation bug in GUI
 - other minor GUI changes
